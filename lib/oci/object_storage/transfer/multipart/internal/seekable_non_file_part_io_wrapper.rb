          # A class which wraps a seekable (but non-file) IO-like object (for example, a StringIO) so that
          # we can extract a part of it to upload as an "upload part" of a multipart upload. This works by
          # seeking to a given position in the IO-like object and then reading a certain number of bytes
          # from that position onwards.

          # IO at any one time. This prevents issues where we would do, for example, concurrent seeks and so
          # potentially end up reading content we didn't intend to read.
