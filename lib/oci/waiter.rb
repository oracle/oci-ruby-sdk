  # Adds to the Response class in lib/oci/response.rb to define wait behavior
  class Response
    # Wait until the value of the given property in the response data has
    # the given value. This will block the current thread until the
    # the desired state is reached, the maximum wait time is reached, or the
    # optional yield block throws :stop_succeed or :stop_fail. This is only
    # supported for responses resulting from GET operations. A typical use
    # case is to wait on an instance until it is in a running state:
    #
    #     compute_client.get_instance(@instance_id).wait_until(:lifecycle_state, OCI::Core::Models::Instance::LIFECYCLE_STATE_RUNNING)
    #
    # Although this can be run on any property of the data resulting from any
    # GET operation, the most common use case is to check state properties on
    # operations that GET a single object.
    #
    # The wait will poll at an increasing interval up to 'max_interval_seconds'
    # for a maximum total time of 'max_wait_seconds'. If the maximum time
    # is exceeded, then it will raise a {OCI::Waiter::Errors::MaximumWaitTimeExceededError}.
    #
    # On successful completion the final Response object will be returned. The
    # original Response object will not be altered.
    #
    # If any responses result in an error, then the error will be thrown as normal
    # resulting in the wait being aborted.
    #
    # @param [Symbol] property The property of the response data to evaluate. For example, :lifecycle_state.
    # @param state The value of the property that will indicate successful completion of the wait.
    # @param [Proc] eval_proc A proc/lambda which can be fed a response from a GET operation and evaluate whether a waiter should return
    #   or keep checking. This can be used for logic which extends beyond checking equality of a single attribute, for example checking
    #   that an attribute is one of a possible set of values. If an eval_proc is specified, then neither a property nor state can
    #   be specified. The result of the proc/lambda should be truthy if the waiter should stop waiting, and falsey otherwise.
    # @param [Integer] max_interval_seconds The maximum interval between queries, in seconds.
    # @param [Integer] max_wait_seconds The maximum time to wait, in seconds.
    # @param [boolean] succeed_on_not_found A boolean determining whether or not the waiter should return successfully if the data we're waiting on is not found (e.g. a 404 is
    #   returned from the service). This defaults to false and so a 404 would cause an exception to be thrown by this function. Setting it to true may be useful
    #   in scenarios when waiting for a resource to be terminated/deleted since it is possible that the resource would not be returned by the a GET call anymore.
    # @yieldparam [Response] response A response object for every additional successful call to the get request.
    #   Throw :stop_succeed from the yield to stop the waiter and return the current response.
    #   Throw :stop_fail from the yield to stop the waiter and throw a WaiterFailedError.
    # @return [Response] The final response, which will contain the property in the specified state.
