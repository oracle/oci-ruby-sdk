module OCI
  # This class provides a wrapper around {OCI::OspGateway::AddressRuleServiceClient} and offers convenience methods
  # for operations that would otherwise need to be chained together. For example, instead of performing an action
  # on a resource (e.g. launching an instance, creating a load balancer) and then using a waiter to wait for the resource
  # to enter a given state, you can call a single method in this class to accomplish the same functionality
  class OspGateway::AddressRuleServiceClientCompositeOperations
    # The {OCI::OspGateway::AddressRuleServiceClient} used to communicate with the service_client
    #
    # @return [OCI::OspGateway::AddressRuleServiceClient]
    attr_reader :service_client

    # Initializes a new AddressRuleServiceClientCompositeOperations
    #
    # @param [OCI::OspGateway::AddressRuleServiceClient] service_client The client used to communicate with the service.
    #   Defaults to a new service client created via {OCI::OspGateway::AddressRuleServiceClient#initialize} with no arguments
