### Changed
- Renamed the namespace OracleBMC to OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure). The namespace OracleBMC still works, but is deprecated and won't show up in any documentation.
- Changed the default location of configuration file to "~/.oci/config" (on windows "C:\\Users\\{user}\\.oci\config"). The old location is deprecated, but still works, if file at new location does not exist.
- *Switched http stack from Typhoeus to Ruby built-in Net::HTTP. Net::HTTP has a known issue for setting no_proxy with Ruby 2.4, details at [https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/1513](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/1513). The workaround is to use hostname instead of IP address.*
- **OCI::ApiClient#request\_option\_overrides was designed to override the options to Typhoeus, now it is used to override the options to Net::HTTP. See [http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.1/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html#method-c-start](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.1/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html#method-c-start) for some of the available options.**
- **OCI::Response#headers changed to OCI::ResponseHeaders which is a readonly and case-insensitive wrapper on hash object.**
- **OCI::Errors::NetworkError#code was mapping to Typhoeus's error message/code but now maps to Net::HTTPResponse's message or exception's message.**
- Support for passing the content of a private key file directly to OCI::Config, using the key_content param. Previously only a path to the private key could be used.
- Ruby SDK now works on Windows operating system as well.
- *Zero for OCI::Config#timeout means 365 days.*

### Fixed

- **Changed the naming convention of OCI::Errors::ServiceError properties to snake_case.**
- **Fixed typo issue in Core::Models::Volume#size_in_mbs (was size_in_m_bs).**
- Fixed the issue where list API filters do not work when a value with spaces is provided.
- Fixed confusing error message when configuration file is not valid. If any required configuration key is missed, OCI::InvalidConfigError will be thrown.
- Fixed method link issue in generated document.
